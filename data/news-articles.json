      "content": "<h2>Electric Vehicle Performance Reaches New Heights</h2><p>Chinese automaker Zeekr, under Geely, is developing an electric hypercar boasting over 2,000 horsepower, according to leaks from Chinese auto bloggers. This would make it one of the most powerful production EVs ever, surpassing even the 1,500hp Xiaomi SU7 Ultra. The rumored model is an upgraded version of Zeekr’s 001 FR, setting new benchmarks for acceleration and track performance.</p><p>Industry analysts note the staggering pace of progress in China's EV market, with domestic brands rapidly closing the gap with Western automakers. If realized, Zeekr's hypercar would join an elite group of electric hypercars - currently only Rimac's Nevera R exceeds this power output. This development underscores China's determination to lead in next-generation automotive technology.</p><h3>Global EV Developments</h3><p>Meanwhile in Europe, Lucid Motors set a new Guinness World Record by driving its Air Grand Touring sedan nearly 750 miles (1,205 km) on a single charge. The marathon journey spanned three countries from St. Moritz, Switzerland to Munich, Germany, beating the previous EV distance record by almost 100 miles. This achievement highlights advancements in battery technology and efficient design, demonstrating that long-distance EV travel is entering a new era.</p>"

Built on Intel's 18A process and Panther Cove architecture, this processor is designed for high-end servers and AI/cloud workloads. A single high-end Diamond Rapids chip consists of four compute tiles of 48 cores each, with servers supporting up to four sockets - enabling 768 cores per machine.</p><h3>Power and Cooling Challenges</h3><p>Such density brings immense performance but also significant challenges. A fully loaded 4-socket server could draw nearly 2,000W of power, requiring advanced cooling solutions. Intel is introducing a new socket design to accommodate these power-hungry CPUs. While promising for cloud and enterprise computing, some analysts question if 2026 might be 'too little, too late' for Intel against competitors like AMD and custom AI chips.</p><p>In related tech news, Amazon's AWS unveiled its custom 'In-Row Heat Exchanger' liquid cooling system designed to handle the heat from Nvidia's newest GPU clusters in its data centers. This proprietary solution addresses the scaling challenges of cooling high-power AI training hardware like Nvidia's 72-core GB200 NVL.</p>"
